I sneaked a couple of soap shaves in last week during my prickly badger break in of the Duke 3, using Fougere Royale, Harris Almond, Irisch Moos and vintage Williams. It was a pleasure to use the soaps again. Anyway, I've managed to kill two previously well-used tubes of TOBS and Pen's creams, and I'm close to finishing my tube of Musgo Real. I've decided to go alskj on the vintage Williams, once the Musgo is gone, and my Duke is broken in.
